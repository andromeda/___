##  _Andromeda_ Definition
    `/ænˈdrɒmɨdə/`
      ~ a spiral galaxy approximately 2.5 million
        light-years  (2.4×1019 km) from  Earth in
        the Andromeda constellation.
      ~ the mythological daughter of Cepheus and
        Cassiopeia, of unprecedented beauty.
      ~ a massively distributed operating system
        for commodity hardware.

## Why Andromeda

      There are approximately  460 globular clusters
      associated with the Andromeda Galaxy.. If this
      doesn't sound like a  distributed system, then
      you're not from planet earth!
